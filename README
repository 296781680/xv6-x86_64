This branch (master) consists of some small changes and rearrangements of
the very cool xv6 project from: http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2012/xv6.html

  "xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
   Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
   but is implemented for a modern x86-based multiprocessor using ANSI C."

The original upstream branch (mirror) was pulled from the git repository
git://pdos.csail.mit.edu/xv6/xv6.git

The PDF books about the rev7 version of xv6 are checked into the books branch
of this repository for easy access.  They come from the xv6 project's home site.

The original README remains as README.orig -- renamed to avoid misrepresenting
this working branch and any local changes as the original project and to 
hopefully avoid people pestering the original authors about bugs I may introduce
while poking at their code.

. . .

The biggest change to the code thus far is to organize it into kernel/,
include/, user/, ulib/, and tools/ subdirectories, and arrange for the
build to put intermediate object files into kobj/ and uobj/ directories,
other intermediates into out/ and the filesystem contents into fs/.
